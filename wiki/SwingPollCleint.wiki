#summary GUI client for TCP Poll Survey server
----
= Introduction =

*The goal of this task was to create an GUI client solution for creating, editing, passing survey and storing results on created before TCP server*

----

= Details =

GUI client combined features of console client and console editor together in convenient user-friendly GUI interface

We had choose of next GUI toolkits:
  * AWT
  * Swing
  * SWT
  * QT/Jambi

We were going to create cross-plathform application, so SWT and QT/Jambi wasn't applicable since they require native libraries(though availile for most popular plathfroms). AWT was standart way to create cross-plathform apps in Java, but rather outdated, so we choosed Swing - pure Java, full-featured GUI toolkit, with ability of applying "Look and Feel" - a way to introduce nice looking GUI theme changes

GUI client have next "Look and Feel" applied as shown on screenshot
