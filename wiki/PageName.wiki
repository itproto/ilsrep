= Introduction =

First challenge as first real task (of course who has accomplished previous 'tasks').


= Teams =
I plan to divide our small team for this task for 2 parts*:
1)vlad, ksi       [sharpTeam]
2)drc,  tkost    [jTeam]
it's for strengthen collaboration in our  small team. Anyway it's not
final division, I'm going  to change for each next group-task team
composition. So don't blame me for your temporary partner ), try to
learn from/teach him.
